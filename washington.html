...No harder fate can be thought of than that of the beast of prey pursued
through the wilderness by the most gnawing torment, rarely satisfied
and even then in such a way that satisfaction is purchased only with
the pain of lascerating combat with other animals or through inordinate
greed and nauseating satiety. To hang on to life madly and
blindly, with no higher aim than to hang on to it; not to know that or
why one is being so heavily punished but, with the stupidity of a fearful
desire, to thirst after precisely this punishment as though after
happiness - that is what it means to be an animal; and if all nature
presses towards man, it thereby intimates that man is necessary for
the redemption of nature from the curse of the life of the animal, and
that in him existence at last holds up before itself a mirror in which
life appears no longer senseless but in its metaphysical significance.
